# Mathematical-Modeling-for-Bioinformatics

# The topic of “mathematical modeling” encompasses a broad range of techniques and approaches, and the precise meaning is defined by the application domain. When dealing with biological systems, the specific combination of challenges includes extreme complexity of the system, lack of (or limited at best) detailed mechanistic understanding of the system, as well as a relatively small amount of the data points. As a result, modeling of biological systems becomes to a large extent an exercise in statistical models and machine learning (“algorithmic models”), augmented by relevant data representation and proper heuristics.
# Topics include: non-linear and linear regression analysis, principal component analysis, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks (NN), Decision Trees, and Bayesian networks.
# Data for analysis include a broad range of biological applications, such as expression analysis, proteomics, high-throughput assays and imaging.
# Programming languages include R and Python.

# Intro to Modeling: basic import of expression data from NCBI GEO, and data manipulation in R such as data transformations.

# Data Normalization, Clustering, Heatmaps, and Feature Selection: apply data normalization, clustering methods, and perform meta-analysis of RNA profiling datasets. Apply current methods of Feature Selection. Discuss importance of data normalization.

# Unsupervised Learning: overview of unsupervised approaches; apply Principal Components Analysis and clustering methods with K-means to high-throughput RNA profiling datasets (RNA-seq).

# Natural language processing for developing predictive models: review and apply concepts behind language processing to make predictions about mechanisms related to disease.

# Supervised Learning: review and apply supervised learning methods, linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, Naive Bayes classifier, and Nearest-neighbor classification. Perform model assessment and selection using AIC criterion, and perform cross-validation. Apply Neural Networks, SVM, and Random Forest to biological dataset.
